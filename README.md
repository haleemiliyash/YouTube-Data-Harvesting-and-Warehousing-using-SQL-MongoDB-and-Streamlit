# YouTube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing-using-SQL-MongoDB-and-Streamlit
YouTube Data harvesting and warehouse project is intention to provide to user to access and analyse data from different channel in Youtube platform.In this project Database like mongoDB,SQL and streamlit are used to provide User friendly web page to access the data which is retrived and stored in the database. 

REQUIREMENT:

Stearmlit: Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. Create beautiful web apps in minutes.

Python:Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

MongoDB:MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

SQL:SQL is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

Google API:Google APIs are application programming interfaces (APIs) developed by Google which allow communication with Google Services and their integration to other services.The APIs provide functionality like analytics, machine learning as a service (the Prediction API) or access to user data (when permission to read the data is given).

 LIBRARIES USED:
 -Streamlit
 -pymongo
 -mysql.connector
 -pandas
 -googleapiclient.discovery
 -isodate

 OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT:
 Aim of the project to Retrive the data from Google API client and storeed in any Database and visualized in user friendly web application.
 
In this project different channel detail are retrived using Youtube API documentation.
Create the separate database and collection in MongoDB and store the details retrived from the Youtube API.
And Create other SQL Database and table Transfer the data from MongoDB to SQL and viewed the the transfered data.
Finally visulize the data using Stream lit Application from SQL Database.
Streamlit Apllication designed as to retrive the data based on 10 Qurey from userend.
